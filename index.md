Despite your best efforts (humidifiers, masks, more water, less wine), maintaining a supple complexion can be a challenge. But finding the right moisturizer for your skin type makes a big difference. After much trial and error, here are the 17 best face moisturizers for all skin types.

Ideal for oily complexions, this moisturizer absorbs almost instantly so that your skin feels softer, nourished, and not at all greasy. The gel-cream consistency spreads evenly, but feels more like a liquid once applied. It is also one of the least-expensive moisturizers on this list, and has close to 5,000 five-star Amazon reviews.

It’s not the flashiest of moisturizers, but this one has a long-standing reputation in the beauty world — it works really well and has zero scent. (It also has almost 4,000 four-star reviews on Amazon). One swipe of the hyaluronic acid and niacinamide-rich formula deeply moisturizes for supersoft skin.

Those with chronic eczema praise this cream for its ability to heal and soothe particularly stubborn patches. It is a French drugstore find that contains thermal spring water (known for its healing properties), but also has clinical results that back up its effectiveness at repairing the skin barrier. It’s so soothing that it’s even suitable to use on infants.

This moisturizer has achieved cult status. It’s been mentioned many times on the Cut as a favorite of Julia Roberts, Victoria Beckham, makeup artists, models, authors, and more. People laud its thickness and the dewy sheen it leaves behind (some people even use it instead of highlighter). It’s primarily meant for the face and body, but it can also be used on the hands, hair, and anyplace else.

The Most Soothing Moisturizer
First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration
First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration

If your skin is flaky and irritated, you will love this rich, soothing moisturizer. It’s a little on the heavier side, so it’s a good pick for those going through the “Retinoid Uglies” (Sephora reviewers also note that it’s great for anyone using Accutane). It’s formulated with shea butter and colloidal oatmeal, which is known to relieve itching.
